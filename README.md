## Why it exists

- turn natural language into executable shell commands
- run persistent chat with tools and MCP servers
- edit files with model assistance
- support agents, skills, sessions, jobs, and local automation
- work with hosted or local models

```bash
$ term-llm exec "find all go files modified today"

> find . -name "*.go" -mtime 0   Uses find with name pattern
  fd -e go --changed-within 1d   Uses fd (faster alternative)
  find . -name "*.go" -newermt "today"   Alternative find syntax
  something else...
```

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samsaffron/term-llm/main/install.sh | sh
```

Or:

```bash
go install github.com/samsaffron/term-llm@latest
```

## 30-second quickstart

No API key needed if you use Zen:

```bash
term-llm exec --provider zen "list files"
term-llm ask --provider zen "explain git rebase"
term-llm chat
```

If you already have a provider key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key
# or OPENAI_API_KEY / GEMINI_API_KEY / OPENROUTER_API_KEY / XAI_API_KEY
```
