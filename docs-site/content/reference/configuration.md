## Configuration commands

```bash
term-llm config
term-llm config edit
term-llm config path
term-llm config get default_provider
term-llm config set default_provider zen
term-llm config reset
```

The main config file lives at:

```text
~/.config/term-llm/config.yaml
```

## Configuration shape

A typical config has a few major parts:

- `default_provider` for the global LLM default
- `providers` for model-specific credentials and routing
- per-command blocks such as `exec`, `ask`, and `edit`
- feature-specific blocks such as `image`, `audio`, `music`, `embed`, `search`, `sessions`, `file_tracking`, `tools`, and `skills`

## Example

```yaml
default_provider: anthropic

providers:
  anthropic:
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6

  openai:
    model: gpt-5.2
    credentials: codex
    # WebSocket transport is enabled by default for built-in OpenAI.
    # Set false to force HTTP/SSE.
    use_websocket: true

  xai:
    model: grok-4-1-fast

  nearai:
    model: zai-org/GLM-5.1-FP8
    fast_model: Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-FP8

  sambanova:
    model: gpt-oss-120b
    fast_model: Meta-Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct

  claude-bin:
    model: opus
    env:
      IS_SANDBOX: "1"

  openrouter:
    model: x-ai/grok-code-fast-1
    app_url: https://github.com/samsaffron/term-llm
    app_title: term-llm

exec:
  suggestions: 3
  instructions: |
    I use Arch Linux with zsh.
    I prefer ripgrep over grep and fd over find.

ask:
  max_turns: 50
  instructions: |
    Be concise. I'm an experienced developer.

chat:
  max_turns: 200

edit:
  model: gpt-5.2-codex
  diff_format: auto

search:
  provider: exa_mcp
  fetch_provider: jina

  exa_mcp:
    url: https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp # optional; this is the default
    api_key: ${EXA_API_KEY} # optional

tools:
  max_tool_output_chars: 20000
```

## Per-command overrides

Each command can override provider and model independently of the global default.

```yaml
default_provider: anthropic

providers:
  anthropic:
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
  openai:
    model: gpt-5.2
  zen:
    model: glm-4.7-free

exec:
  provider: zen
  model: glm-4.7-free

ask:
  model: claude-opus-4

edit:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-5.2-codex
```

Precedence is:

1. CLI flag such as `--provider openai:gpt-5.2`
2. per-command config such as `exec.provider` or `ask.model`
3. global provider selection via `default_provider` and `providers.<name>.model`

## Agentic turn limits

Agentic commands can make multiple provider calls while they execute tools and feed results back to the model. `max_turns` caps that loop.

Defaults:

- `ask.max_turns`: `50`
- `exec` CLI flag default: `50`
- `chat.max_turns`: `200`
- Agent YAML `max_turns` overrides command/config defaults when an agent is selected.
- A CLI `--max-turns N` flag overrides both config and agent YAML.

```yaml
ask:
  max_turns: 50

chat:
  max_turns: 200
```

## Parallel tool execution

Models may request many independent tool calls in a single turn, such as several `read_file`, `grep`, or `glob` calls. term-llm executes independent tool calls concurrently when parallel tool calls are enabled by the provider/request, but caps one model turn at **20 concurrently running tool calls**. Additional tool calls from the same turn are queued and run as earlier calls finish.

This is a built-in safety limit rather than a config option today. It preserves useful batching while preventing a single response from spawning an unbounded number of shells, greps, reads, or subagents at once.

## Reasoning and thinking display

Reasoning display controls how provider-marked thinking/summary content is shown in term-llm. It is separate from provider reasoning effort suffixes such as `openai:gpt-5.2-high`, `anthropic:...-thinking`, or `vllm` provider `-high`.

By default, term-llm shows display-safe provider summaries and non-encrypted provider thinking as collapsed thought blocks in interactive chat:

- Generic provider thinking renders as `▸ Thinking...`.
- Provider/summary titles render as `▸ Thought: <title>`.
- Expanding a block shows the body; encrypted reasoning/signatures are never displayed.
- In chat, `Ctrl+E` toggles thought detail globally and clicking a thought header toggles that block.
- Ctrl+O inspector shows non-encrypted reasoning details for saved messages.

Default policy:

```yaml
reasoning:
  display: auto                  # auto => collapsed
  source: summary_or_provider_safe
  status: title
  history: collapsed
  export: ask
  raw: false
  max_summary_chars: 12000
  max_raw_chars: 20000
  extract_titles: true
  hidden_label: Thinking...
  persist_summaries: true
```

Important options:

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `display` | `auto`, `off`, `status`, `collapsed`, `expanded`, `raw` | Interactive display mode. `raw` still requires `raw: true`; otherwise it falls back to collapsed. |
| `source` | `summary_only`, `summary_or_provider_safe`, `all` | Which provider reasoning sources interactive UI may show. Raw export/replay requires `all`. |
| `status` | `none`, `generic`, `title`, `summary` | How reasoning affects the live status/spinner text. |
| `history` | `none`, `collapsed`, `expanded`, `transcript_only` | Whether saved/streamed thought blocks are visible in chat history. |
| `export` | `never`, `ask`, `summaries`, `raw` | What session export may include. Raw export also requires `raw: true` and `source: all`. |
| `raw` | boolean | Explicit safety gate for raw reasoning display/export. |
| `hidden_label` | string | Label for untitled collapsed blocks, default `Thinking...`. |

Per-surface overrides inherit the top-level reasoning policy:

```yaml
reasoning:
  display: collapsed
  chat:
    display: expanded
  ask:
    status: title
    history: none
  serve:
    display: off
```

For local debugging only, `TERM_LLM_SHOW_RAW_REASONING=1` forces `display: raw`, `source: all`, and `raw: true` for the resolved surface.

## Sessions config

```yaml
sessions:
  enabled: true
  max_age_days: 0
  max_count: 0
  path: ""
  strip_image_base64: false
```

Use this to control whether sessions are persisted, how long they are kept, and where the SQLite database lives. By default, uploaded image base64 is kept in the DB for portability; set `strip_image_base64: true` to store only image paths/metadata when a local `ImagePath` exists, reducing DB size at the cost of requiring the uploads directory to move with the database.

## File change tracking config

```yaml
file_tracking:
  enabled: false
  max_file_bytes: 2097152 # 2 MiB per-file content cap
  max_session_bytes: 104857600 # 100 MiB retained content per session
  max_total_bytes: 1073741824 # 1 GiB whole-database cap across sessions
  path: "" # optional DB path override
```

Opt-in. When enabled, term-llm records the before/after contents of files that agent tools create, modify, or delete, so the web UI can show a live per-session diff sidebar.

Enable it with:

```bash
term-llm config set file_tracking.enabled true
```

or by adding the YAML above to your config file.

**Privacy note:** this persists actual file contents (not just paths) to a local SQLite database at `~/.local/share/term-llm/file_history.db`, separate from `sessions.db`. Contents are gzip-compressed and content-addressed. Files larger than `max_file_bytes`, binary files, and changes beyond the per-session budget are recorded as metadata only ("content not retained"). History for deleted sessions is swept on startup, following `sessions.max_age_days`; if the database still exceeds `max_total_bytes`, the least recently changed sessions' history is pruned until it fits.

Shell-made changes are tracked best-effort: commands that declare an `affected_paths` hint are snapshotted precisely; otherwise term-llm relies on `git status` (when inside a repository) and re-checking files the session already touched. Broad scripts writing to non-git directories without a hint may not appear in the diff sidebar.

## Search config

```yaml
search:
  provider: exa_mcp
  fetch_provider: jina
  force_external: false

  exa_mcp:
    url: https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp # optional; this is the default
    api_key: ${EXA_API_KEY} # optional, raises free-tier limits

  perplexity:
    api_key: ${PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}

  exa:
    api_key: ${EXA_API_KEY}

  brave:
    api_key: ${BRAVE_API_KEY}
```

Defaults are `provider: exa_mcp` and `fetch_provider: jina`: external search uses Exa's remote MCP server, while `read_url` uses Jina Reader. Set `fetch_provider: exa_mcp` to fetch pages through Exa MCP as well, or `fetch_provider: none` to omit the external `read_url` tool.

Search is large enough to deserve its own page; see [Search](/guides/search/).

## Image, audio, music, transcription, and embedding config

```yaml
image:
  provider: gemini
  output_dir: ~/Pictures/term-llm

audio:
  provider: venice
  output_dir: ~/Music/term-llm
  venice:
    api_key: ${VENICE_API_KEY}
    model: tts-kokoro
    voice: af_sky
    format: mp3

music:
  provider: venice
  output_dir: ~/Music/term-llm
  venice:
    api_key: ${VENICE_API_KEY}
    model: elevenlabs-sound-effects-v2
    format: mp3
  elevenlabs:
    api_key: ${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY}
    model: music_v1
    format: mp3_44100_128

transcription:
  provider: venice
  venice:
    api_key: ${VENICE_API_KEY}
    model: nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3
  elevenlabs:
    api_key: ${ELEVENLABS_API_KEY}
    model: scribe_v2

embed:
  provider: gemini
```

Each feature block can hold provider-specific credentials and defaults. The image, audio, music, transcription, and embedding providers are independent of the main text provider.

## Provider-specific environment overrides

Providers that shell out to local CLIs can accept extra subprocess environment variables via `providers.<name>.env`.

For `claude-bin`, term-llm also disables Claude Code hooks by default so user-level Claude automation does not leak into inference sessions. Set `providers.claude-bin.enable_hooks: true` if you explicitly want Claude Code hooks to run.

Example for Claude Code when term-llm runs inside a trusted sandboxed container:

```yaml
providers:
  claude-bin:
    model: opus
    env:
      IS_SANDBOX: "1"
      # Generate a long-lived token with: claude setup-token
      # Useful in CI or headless environments where interactive login isn't possible
      CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: "your-oauth-token-here"
    # Optional: re-enable Claude Code hooks for this provider
    # enable_hooks: true
```

`providers.<name>.env` values support the same resolution rules as other deferred config values:

- `file://path` → trimmed file contents
- `file://path#json.path` → JSON field extracted from the file
- `op://...` → 1Password secret lookup
- `$()` → command output
- `${VAR}` / `$VAR` → environment variable expansion

This is passed only to the provider subprocess. It does not mutate your parent shell environment.

## Provider service tier

Built-in `openai` and `chatgpt` text providers support the Responses API `service_tier` field. Omit `service_tier` to send no service tier. Set it to `fast` (or the API value `priority`) to request fast/priority service for supported models and accounts:

```yaml
providers:
  openai:
    model: gpt-5.4
    service_tier: fast

  chatgpt:
    model: gpt-5.5-medium
    service_tier: priority
```

In chat mode, `/fast` toggles this service tier for the current session. It does not rewrite your config file.

## Provider file upload policy

Provider configs can override which MIME types may be forwarded as native file/document inputs. This matters for the web/API `input_file` path: term-llm saves uploads locally first, then either sends a native file part, embeds text-like files as prompt text, or falls back to a local marker for unsupported binaries.

Built-in defaults are conservative:

- `openai`, `chatgpt`, and `copilot` allow OpenAI Responses-style document/spreadsheet/text MIME types natively by default.
- Providers without an implemented native file path do not forward native file parts; they use text fallback/marker behavior instead.
- Text-like files (`txt`, `md`, `csv`, `tsv`, `json`, `yaml`, `xml`, `html`, and common code files) can still be embedded as ordinary text on providers without native file support, wrapped in explicit begin/end file markers.

Example custom policy:

```yaml
providers:
  openai:
    model: gpt-5.4
    file_upload:
      native_mime_types:
        - application/pdf
        - text/plain
        - text/markdown
        - text/csv
        - application/json
      max_native_bytes: 20971520
      text_embed_mime_types:
        - text/plain
        - text/markdown
        - text/csv
        - application/json
      max_text_embed_bytes: 20971520
```

To disable native forwarding while keeping text fallback available:

```yaml
providers:
  openai:
    file_upload:
      native_mime_types: []
```

The server still enforces its upload limits (10 attachments, 20 MB decoded per attachment, and 50 MB total JSON request body). Provider-native limits may be lower or higher; if a provider rejects a native file type, remove it from `native_mime_types` so term-llm falls back to text/marker behavior.

## Provider WebSocket transport

Built-in `openai` and `chatgpt` text providers use the Responses WebSocket transport by default for lower-latency agent/tool loops. The WebSocket path keeps a persistent connection and, when safe, continues turns with `previous_response_id` plus only the new user/tool input. If the WebSocket connect/write step fails, term-llm falls back to HTTP/SSE; if a WebSocket continuation is rejected because the prior response state is unavailable, it retries that turn once with full state.

Disable it per provider if you need to force HTTP/SSE:

```yaml
providers:
  openai:
    use_websocket: false
  chatgpt:
    use_websocket: false
```

OpenAI-compatible providers (`type: openai_compatible`, including local/self-hosted endpoints and OpenRouter-style compatible APIs) do **not** enable WebSockets by default. They continue to use HTTP/SSE unless explicitly supported and wired by that provider.

## vLLM providers

Use `type: vllm` for vLLM servers that should receive reasoning-model chat-template controls. It uses the same `base_url`, `url`, `api_key`, `context_window`, and `max_output_tokens` fields as `openai_compatible`, but maps term-llm reasoning effort suffixes into vLLM request fields for supported model families:

```yaml
providers:
  cdck_qwen:
    type: vllm
    base_url: https://gpu-server.example.com:8000/v1
    model: Qwen/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B
    api_key: ${CDCK_QWEN_API_KEY}
    context_window: 200000
    max_output_tokens: 50000
```

```bash
term-llm ask -p cdck_qwen       "quick answer" # thinking disabled by default
term-llm ask -p cdck_qwen-low   "think a bit"  # budget 1024
term-llm ask -p cdck_qwen-high  "think hard"   # budget 10000
```

The suffix is stripped before the model name is sent upstream. For example `cdck_qwen-high` still sends `Qwen/Qwen3.5-122B-A10B` as the model and adds `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=true` plus `thinking_token_budget=10000`. Plain/default Qwen requests send `enable_thinking=false` and omit `thinking_token_budget`; budgeted Qwen efforts require a vLLM server configured to accept `thinking_token_budget` (recent vLLM requires `--reasoning-config`).

DeepSeek served through vLLM uses a different official shape. If the model name contains `deepseek`, term-llm auto-selects DeepSeek controls; for aliased or mistitled deployments, set `vllm_thinking_param: thinking`:

```yaml
providers:
  cdck_deepseek:
    type: vllm
    base_url: https://gpu-server.example.com:8000/v1
    model: ds31
    vllm_thinking_param: thinking
```

DeepSeek efforts map to `chat_template_kwargs.thinking` and nested `chat_template_kwargs.reasoning_effort`: default/off sends `thinking=false`, `low`/`medium`/`high` send `thinking=true, reasoning_effort=high`, and `xhigh`/`max` send `thinking=true, reasoning_effort=max`. DeepSeek requests do not send `thinking_token_budget`.

term-llm persists streamed reasoning and replays it as assistant `reasoning` on future vLLM turns so vLLM's chat template and prefix cache can see the same prior reasoning. vLLM may still report `reasoning_tokens: 0` in usage metadata even when reasoning text is present; that is a vLLM accounting limitation.

## Dynamic secrets and endpoints

term-llm supports dynamic resolution for some config values:

- `op://...` for 1Password secret references
- `srv://...` for DNS SRV-based endpoint discovery
- `$()` for command-based resolution

Example:

```yaml
providers:
  production-llm:
    type: vllm
    model: Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B
    url: "srv://_vllm._tcp.ml.company.com/v1/chat/completions"
    api_key: "op://Infrastructure/vLLM Cluster/credential?account=company.1password.com"
```

These values are resolved lazily when term-llm actually needs them.

## WebRTC direct routing config

```yaml
serve:
  webrtc:
    enabled: true
    signaling_url: https://signal.example.com/webrtc
    token: your-signaling-token
    stun_urls:
      - stun:stun.l.google.com:19302
    max_conns: 10
```

These values match the `--webrtc-*` CLI flags. See the [WebRTC direct routing](/guides/webrtc-direct-routing/) guide for full details.

## Skills config

```yaml
skills:
  enabled: true
  auto_invoke: true
  metadata_budget_tokens: 8000
  max_visible_skills: 50
  include_project_skills: true
  include_ecosystem_paths: true
  always_enabled: [git, code-review]
  never_auto: [expensive-api-skill]
```

Controls the skills system: portable instruction bundles that inject task-specific context into the system prompt. Skills are disabled by default; set `enabled: true` to allow auto-invocation, or use `--skills` on any command for one-off activation. See [Skills](/guides/skills/) for the full guide.

## Diagnostics

```yaml
diagnostics:
  enabled: true
```

When edit retries fail, diagnostics can capture prompts, partial responses, and failure context for inspection.
