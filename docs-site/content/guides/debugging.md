Use `--debug` to print provider-level diagnostics (requests, model info, etc.). Use `--debug-raw` for a timestamped, raw view of tool calls, tool results, and reconstructed requests. Raw debug is most useful for troubleshooting tool calling and search.

### Debug Logging

term-llm maintains debug logs for troubleshooting. Use the `debug-log` command to view and manage them:

```bash
term-llm debug-log                           # Show recent logs
term-llm debug-log list                      # List available log files
term-llm debug-log show [file]               # Show a specific log file
term-llm debug-log tail                      # Show last N lines
term-llm debug-log tail --follow             # Follow logs in real-time
term-llm debug-log search "pattern"          # Search logs for a pattern
term-llm debug-log clean                     # Clean old log files
term-llm debug-log clean --days 7            # Keep only last 7 days
term-llm debug-log export --json             # Export logs as JSON
term-llm debug-log enable                    # Enable debug logging
term-llm debug-log disable                   # Disable debug logging
term-llm debug-log status                    # Show logging status
term-llm debug-log path                      # Print log directory path
```

**Key flags:**
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--days N` | Limit to logs from last N days |
| `--show-tools` | Include tool calls/results in output |
| `--raw` | Show raw log entries without formatting |
| `--json` | Output as JSON |
| `--follow` | Follow logs in real-time (with tail) |
