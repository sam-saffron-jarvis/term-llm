```bash
term-llm exec "your request here"
```

Use arrow keys to select a command, Enter to execute, or press `h` for detailed help on the highlighted command. Select "something else..." to refine your request.

Use `term-llm chat` for a persistent session.

```bash
term-llm chat
```

### Using Agents

Use the `@agent` prefix syntax to use a specific agent:

```bash
term-llm ask @reviewer "review this code"     # use reviewer agent
term-llm chat @codebase                        # explore a repository
term-llm loop @web-researcher --done-file ...  # use web-researcher agent in loop
term-llm ask @shell "find the 3 biggest files"
```

See [Agents](/guides/agents/) for more details on creating and managing agents.

### Using Skills

Skills inject task-specific context into any command without changing the model or provider:

```bash
term-llm ask --skills git "how to squash commits"   # use git skill
term-llm chat --skills git,docker                   # combine multiple skills
term-llm edit --skills refactoring -f main.go "refactor this"
term-llm exec --skills devops "set up a cron job"
```

Use `--skills all` to load every available skill, or `--skills none` to suppress defaults.

Manage skills with the `skills` subcommand:

```bash
term-llm skills                    # list all skills
term-llm skills new my-skill       # create a new skill
term-llm skills show git           # inspect a skill
term-llm skills browse             # browse available skills
```

See [Skills](/guides/skills/) for the full guide on creating, sharing, and extending skills with custom tools.

### Chat Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` | Send message |
| `Ctrl+J` or `Alt+Enter` | Insert newline |
| `Ctrl+C` | Quit |
| `Ctrl+K` | Clear conversation |
| `Ctrl+S` | Toggle web search |
| `Ctrl+P` | Command palette |
| `Ctrl+T` | MCP server picker |
| `Ctrl+L` | Switch model |
| `Ctrl+N` | New session |
| `Ctrl+F` | Attach file |
| `Ctrl+O` | Conversation inspector |
| `Esc` | Cancel streaming |
| `Left click` | Move cursor in chat input |
| `Shift+drag` | Select/copy chat output text in terminal |

### TUI attachments

In `term-llm chat`, `Ctrl+F` or `/file <path>` attaches a local text file to the next message. Globs are supported by `/file`, and `/file clear` removes pending file attachments. The TUI reads file contents into the prompt as text, rejects binary files, and accepts text files up to 20 MB. Embedded file contents are wrapped in explicit begin/end markers so the model can tell where each attachment starts and ends. Very large text files can still exceed a model's context window or cost more tokens.

Pasting an image from the clipboard attaches it as an image when the terminal/clipboard integration exposes image data. Pasted images use the same 20 MB decoded limit as web/API uploads.

### Chat Slash Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show help |
| `/clear` | Clear conversation |
| `/model` | Show current model |
| `/search` | Toggle web search |
| `/fast` | Toggle fast/priority service tier for supported OpenAI/ChatGPT models |
| `/mcp` | Manage MCP servers |
| `/goal` | Set, edit, pause, resume, clear, or show the persistent session goal |
| `/share [new] [public]` | Share the session as a GitHub Gist; repeat to update or create a new gist |
| `/side [question]` | Fork or reopen a side conversation with hidden point-in-time context |
| `/main` | Return to the main conversation without closing the side |
| `/side close` | Explicitly close the current/open side conversation |
| `/quit` | Exit chat |

When web search is enabled, the chat status line shows `web`; when fast service tier is enabled, it shows `fast`.

### Side conversations

Use a side conversation for a focused question without adding the main transcript to the side's visible history. The fork captures the main conversation's structured model context at that instant, including completed tool protocol state, while keeping it out of child pagination, search, message counts, exports, and prompt history. Main and side sessions have independent runs and local transcripts and share the same working directory.

Only one side can be open for a main conversation, and sides cannot be nested. In the web UI, **Back to main** only navigates; it does not close the side, so **Open side** returns to it. Use **Close side** when finished. The TUI equivalents are `/side`, `/main`, and `/side close`. Side runs always require explicit approval for shell and workspace mutations and cannot delegate to subagents, even when the main session uses yolo mode.

A side is persisted across crashes and restarts. Automatic resume remains rooted at the main conversation; reopen the side explicitly to continue it.

### Persistent goals

Use `/goal` in chat when you want the agent to keep pursuing a durable objective across automatic continuations:

```text
/goal set finish the migration and verify every test
/goal set --budget 50000 finish the migration and verify every test
/goal edit finish the migration, update docs, and verify every test
/goal pause
/goal resume
/goal clear
```

An active goal is stored with the session, so it survives reloads and can continue from the TUI, web UI, or other runner-backed surfaces. While a goal is active, term-llm injects goal-steering prompts between turns and exposes `get_goal`/`update_goal` tools to the model. The model should call `update_goal` only when the objective is genuinely complete or strictly blocked; otherwise the runner continues until the goal is paused, completed, blocked, cancelled, or its optional token budget is exhausted. The status line shows a `goal` chip with token usage when a goal is present.

Changing sessions, compacting, handing over, or switching models pauses the current goal so the next turn does not unexpectedly continue old work.

### Flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--provider` | | Override provider, optionally with model (e.g., `openai:gpt-5.2`) |
| `--file` | `-f` | File(s) to include as context (supports globs, line ranges, 'clipboard') |
| `--auto-pick` | `-a` | Auto-execute the best suggestion without prompting (exec only) |
| `--agent` | `-a` | Use a specific agent (ask/chat only; see also `@agent` syntax) |
| `--skills` | | Skills mode: all, none, or comma-separated names |
| `--max N` | `-n N` | Limit to N options in the selection UI |
| `--search` | `-s` | Enable web search and page reading (see [Search](/guides/search/) for providers) |
| `--native-search` | | Use provider's native search (override config) |
| `--no-native-search` | | Force external search tools instead of native |
| `--print-only` | `-p` | Print the command instead of executing it |
| `--debug` | `-d` | Show provider debug information |
| `--debug-raw` | | Emit raw debug logs with timestamps (tool calls/results, raw requests) |
| `--json` | | Emit JSONL event stream on stdout, one event per line (ask only; see below) |
| `--system-message` | `-m` | Custom system message/instructions |
| `--stats` | | Show session statistics (time, tokens, tool calls) |
| `--no-session` | | Disable session persistence for this command |
| `--session-db` | | Override sessions database path (supports `:memory:`) |
| `--max-turns` | | Max agentic turns for tool execution (default: 50 for ask/exec, 200 for chat) |
| Tool concurrency | | When a model emits many parallel tool calls in one turn, term-llm runs at most 20 tool calls concurrently and queues the rest for that turn. |
| `--yolo` | | Auto-approve all tool operations (for unattended runs) |

**Note:** The `-a` short flag has different meanings:
- In `exec`: `-a` is `--auto-pick` (auto-execute best suggestion)
- In `ask`/`chat`: `-a` is `--agent` (use a specific agent)

### Examples

```bash
term-llm exec "list files by size"              # interactive selection
term-llm exec "compress folder" --auto-pick     # auto-execute best

term-llm ask -f code.go "explain this code"     # with file context
term-llm ask -f code.go:50-100 "explain this function"  # specific lines
term-llm ask -f clipboard "what is this?"       # from clipboard
cat README.md | term-llm ask "summarize this"   # pipe stdin

term-llm edit "add tests" -f "*.go" --dry-run    # preview changes
term-llm edit "use the API" -f main.go -c api/client.go  # with context

# Generate images
term-llm image "a sunset over mountains"
term-llm image "logo design" --provider flux    # use specific provider
term-llm image "make it purple" -i photo.png    # edit existing image

# Generate videos (Venice AI)
term-llm video "a corgi surfing at sunset"
term-llm video "make Romeo blink" -i romeo.png
term-llm video "astronaut on mars" --quote-only
```

### JSON event stream (`ask --json`)

`term-llm ask --json` emits a newline-delimited JSON (JSONL) event stream on
stdout, one event per line, for scripting and automation. It implies `--text`
(no rich terminal rendering) and is incompatible with `--debug-raw`. Human
progress and warnings stay on stderr.

Every event shares an envelope:

```json
{"type": "text.delta", "seq": 3, "ts": "2026-04-19T10:30:00.123456789Z", "text": "Hello"}
```

Event types, in typical order:

| Type | Payload |
|------|---------|
| `session.started` | `session_id`, `provider`, `model`, `agent`, `tools`, `mcp`, `yolo`, `search`, `resuming` |
| `text.delta` | `text`, one chunk of streamed response |
| `tool.started` | `call_id`, `name`, `info`, `args` (raw JSON or `null`) |
| `tool.completed` | `call_id`, `name`, `info`, `success` |
| `usage` | `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cached_input_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens` |
| `phase` | `phase` |
| `retry` | `attempt`, `max`, `wait_seconds` |
| `image` | `path` |
| `diff` | `path`, `old`, `new`, `line` |
| `progressive.result` | `exit_reason`, `finalized`, plus optional `session_id`/`sequence`/`reason`/`message`/`progress`/`final_response`/`fallback_text` (only with `--progressive`) |
| `error` | `message` |
| `stats` | `duration_ms`, `llm_ms`, `tool_ms`, token counts, `tool_calls`, `llm_calls` |
| `done` | `tokens` |

The last two events are always `stats` then `done`, even on context cancellation
or errors. `seq` starts at 0 and strictly increments.
